  Represents a Customer Portal. Customer Portal is a hosted, customizable interface for managing device access. It enables you to embed secure, pre-authenticated access flows into your productâ€”either by sharing a link with users or embedding a view in an iframe.

  With Customer Portal, you no longer need to build out frontend experiences for physical access, thermostats, and sensors. Instead, you can ship enterprise-grade access control experiences in a fraction of the time, while maintaining your product's branding and user experience.
  
  Seam hosts these flows, handling everything from account connection and device mapping to full-featured device control.
