  Represents a Seam Instant Key. For issuing Bluetooth mobile keys, Instant Keys are the fastest way to share access. With a single API call, you can create a mobile key and send it through text or email or embed it in your own app.

  Thereâ€™s no app to install, nor account to create. Your user just taps a link and gets a lightweight, native-feeling experience using iOS App Clip or Instant Apps on Android. Further, Instant Keys work offline, so even in areas with poor cellular or Wi-Fi, like elevator banks or concrete-walled hallways, the Instant Keys still work.
