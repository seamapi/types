Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

      /** Represents a smart lock [access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes).
    
    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly. Using the Seam Access Code API, you can easily generate access codes on the hundreds of door lock models with which we integrate.
    
    Seam supports programming two types of access codes: [ongoing](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#ongoing-access-codes) and [time-bound](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#time-bound-access-codes). To differentiate between the two, refer to the `type` property of the access code. Ongoing codes display as `ongoing`, whereas time-bound codes are labeled `time_bound`. An ongoing access code is active, until it has been removed from the device. To specify an ongoing access code, leave both `starts_at` and `ends_at` empty. A time-bound access code will be programmed at the `starts_at` time and removed at the `ends_at` time.
    
    In addition, for certain devices, Seam also supports [offline access codes](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#offline-access-codes). Offline access (PIN) codes are designed for door locks that might not always maintain an internet connection. For this type of access code, the device manufacturer uses encryption keys (tokens) to create server-based registries of algorithmically-generated offline PIN codes. Because the tokens remain synchronized with the managed devices, the locks do not require an active internet connection—and you do not need to be near the locks—to create an offline access code. Then, owners or managers can share these offline codes with users through a variety of mechanisms, such as messaging applications. That is, lock users do not need to install a smartphone application to receive an offline access code. */

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

      /** Represents a smart lock [access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes).
    
    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly. Using the Seam Access Code API, you can easily generate access codes on the hundreds of door lock models with which we integrate.
    
    Seam supports programming two types of access codes: [ongoing](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#ongoing-access-codes) and [time-bound](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#time-bound-access-codes). To differentiate between the two, refer to the `type` property of the access code. Ongoing codes display as `ongoing`, whereas time-bound codes are labeled `time_bound`. An ongoing access code is active, until it has been removed from the device. To specify an ongoing access code, leave both `starts_at` and `ends_at` empty. A time-bound access code will be programmed at the `starts_at` time and removed at the `ends_at` time.
    
    In addition, for certain devices, Seam also supports [offline access codes](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#offline-access-codes). Offline access (PIN) codes are designed for door locks that might not always maintain an internet connection. For this type of access code, the device manufacturer uses encryption keys (tokens) to create server-based registries of algorithmically-generated offline PIN codes. Because the tokens remain synchronized with the managed devices, the locks do not require an active internet connection—and you do not need to be near the locks—to create an offline access code. Then, owners or managers can share these offline codes with users through a variety of mechanisms, such as messaging applications. That is, lock users do not need to install a smartphone application to receive an offline access code. */

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

      /** Represents a smart lock [access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes).
    
    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly. Using the Seam Access Code API, you can easily generate access codes on the hundreds of door lock models with which we integrate.
    
    Seam supports programming two types of access codes: [ongoing](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#ongoing-access-codes) and [time-bound](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#time-bound-access-codes). To differentiate between the two, refer to the `type` property of the access code. Ongoing codes display as `ongoing`, whereas time-bound codes are labeled `time_bound`. An ongoing access code is active, until it has been removed from the device. To specify an ongoing access code, leave both `starts_at` and `ends_at` empty. A time-bound access code will be programmed at the `starts_at` time and removed at the `ends_at` time.
    
    In addition, for certain devices, Seam also supports [offline access codes](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#offline-access-codes). Offline access (PIN) codes are designed for door locks that might not always maintain an internet connection. For this type of access code, the device manufacturer uses encryption keys (tokens) to create server-based registries of algorithmically-generated offline PIN codes. Because the tokens remain synchronized with the managed devices, the locks do not require an active internet connection—and you do not need to be near the locks—to create an offline access code. Then, owners or managers can share these offline codes with users through a variety of mechanisms, such as messaging applications. That is, lock users do not need to install a smartphone application to receive an offline access code. */

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

      /** Represents a smart lock [access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes).
    
    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly. Using the Seam Access Code API, you can easily generate access codes on the hundreds of door lock models with which we integrate.
    
    Seam supports programming two types of access codes: [ongoing](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#ongoing-access-codes) and [time-bound](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#time-bound-access-codes). To differentiate between the two, refer to the `type` property of the access code. Ongoing codes display as `ongoing`, whereas time-bound codes are labeled `time_bound`. An ongoing access code is active, until it has been removed from the device. To specify an ongoing access code, leave both `starts_at` and `ends_at` empty. A time-bound access code will be programmed at the `starts_at` time and removed at the `ends_at` time.
    
    In addition, for certain devices, Seam also supports [offline access codes](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#offline-access-codes). Offline access (PIN) codes are designed for door locks that might not always maintain an internet connection. For this type of access code, the device manufacturer uses encryption keys (tokens) to create server-based registries of algorithmically-generated offline PIN codes. Because the tokens remain synchronized with the managed devices, the locks do not require an active internet connection—and you do not need to be near the locks—to create an offline access code. Then, owners or managers can share these offline codes with users through a variety of mechanisms, such as messaging applications. That is, lock users do not need to install a smartphone application to receive an offline access code. */

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly.
    
    When you create an access code on a device in Seam, it is created as a managed access code. Access codes that exist on a device that were not created through Seam are considered unmanaged codes. We strictly limit the operations that can be performed on unmanaged codes.
    
    Prior to using Seam to manage your devices, you may have used another lock management system to manage the access codes on your devices. Where possible, we help you keep any existing access codes on devices and transition those codes to ones managed by your Seam workspace.
    
    Not all providers support unmanaged access codes. The following providers do not support unmanaged access codes:

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

    An access code is a code used for a keypad or pinpad device. Unlike physical keys, which can easily be lost or duplicated, PIN codes can be customized, tracked, and altered on the fly.
    
    When you create an access code on a device in Seam, it is created as a managed access code. Access codes that exist on a device that were not created through Seam are considered unmanaged codes. We strictly limit the operations that can be performed on unmanaged codes.
    
    Prior to using Seam to manage your devices, you may have used another lock management system to manage the access codes on your devices. Where possible, we help you keep any existing access codes on devices and transition those codes to ones managed by your Seam workspace.
    
    Not all providers support unmanaged access codes. The following providers do not support unmanaged access codes:

Note that the name provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam and is not necessarily the name that will appear in the lock provider's app or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`. To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

This is because lock providers may have constraints on names, such as length, uniqueness, or characters that can be used.

To provide a consistent experience, Seam identifies the code on Seam by its name but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name to meet provider constraints. To help your users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property and, optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components). */

    Some access control systems use [access group](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems/assigning-users-to-access-groups), which are sets of users, combined with sets of permissions. These permissions include both the set of areas or assets that the users can access and the schedule during which the users can access these areas or assets. Instead of assigning access rights individually to each access control system user, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, administrators can assign users to an access group, thereby ensuring that the users inherit all the permissions associated with the access group. Using access groups streamlines the process of managing large numbers of access control system users, especially in bigger organizations or complexes.

    Some access control systems require credentials to be encoded onto plastic key cards using a card encoder. This process involves the following two key steps:
    
    1. Credential creation
       Configure the access parameters for the credential.
    2. Card encoding
       Write the credential data onto the card using a compatible card encoder.
    
    Separately, the Seam API also supports card scanning, which enables you to scan and read the encoded data on a card. You can use this action to confirm consistency with access control system records or diagnose discrepancies if needed.
    
     See [Working with Card Encoders and Scanners](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems/working-with-card-encoders-and-scanners).
    
    To verify if your access control system requires a card encoder, see the corresponding [system integration guide](https://docs.seam.co/latest/device-and-system-integration-guides/overview#access-control-systems). */

Additionally, these credentials can have a schedule or validity period.

    An `acs_user` typically refers to an individual who requires access, like an employee or resident. Each user can possess multiple credentials that serve as their keys or identifiers for access. The type of credential can vary widely. For example, in the Salto system, a user can have a PIN code, a mobile app account, and a fob. In other platforms, it is not uncommon for a user to have more than one of the same credential type, such as multiple key cards. Additionally, these credentials can have a schedule or validity period.

    Connect Webviews are fully-embedded client-side components that you add to your app. Your users interact with your embedded Connect Webviews to link their IoT device or system accounts to Seam. That is, Connect Webviews walk your users through the process of logging in to their device or system accounts. Seam handles all the authentication steps, and—once your user has completed the authorization through your app—you can access and control their devices or systems using the Seam API.
    
    Connect Webviews perform credential validation, multifactor authentication (when applicable), and error handling for each brand that Seam supports. Further, Connect Webviews work across all modern browsers and platforms, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
    
    To enable a user to connect their device or system account to Seam through your app, first create a `connect_webview`. Once created, this `connect_webview` includes a URL that you can use to open an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp) or new window containing the Connect Webview for your user.
    
    When you create a Connect Webview, specify the desired provider category key in the `provider_category` parameter. Alternately, to specify a list of providers explicitly, use the `accepted_providers` parameter with a list of device provider keys.
    
    To list all providers within a category, use `/devices/list_device_providers` with the desired `provider_category` filter. To list all provider keys, use `/devices/list_device_providers` with no filters. */

    Connect Webviews are fully-embedded client-side components that you add to your app. Your users interact with your embedded Connect Webviews to link their IoT device or system accounts to Seam. That is, Connect Webviews walk your users through the process of logging in to their device or system accounts. Seam handles all the authentication steps, and—once your user has completed the authorization through your app—you can access and control their devices or systems using the Seam API.
    
    Connect Webviews perform credential validation, multifactor authentication (when applicable), and error handling for each brand that Seam supports. Further, Connect Webviews work across all modern browsers and platforms, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
    
    To enable a user to connect their device or system account to Seam through your app, first create a `connect_webview`. Once created, this `connect_webview` includes a URL that you can use to open an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp) or new window containing the Connect Webview for your user.
    
    When you create a Connect Webview, specify the desired provider category key in the `provider_category` parameter. Alternately, to specify a list of providers explicitly, use the `accepted_providers` parameter with a list of device provider keys.
    
    To list all providers within a category, use `/devices/list_device_providers` with the desired `provider_category` filter. To list all provider keys, use `/devices/list_device_providers` with no filters. */

    You create each client session with a custom `user_identifier_key`. Normally, the `user_identifier_key` is a user ID that your application provides.
    
    When calling the Seam API from your backend using an API key, you can pass the `user_identifier_key` as a parameter to limit results to the associated client session. For example, `/devices/list?user_identifier_key=123` only returns devices associated with the client session created with the `user_identifier_key` `123`.
    
    A client session has a token that you can use with the Seam JavaScript SDK to make requests from the client (browser) directly to the Seam API. The token restricts the user's access to only the devices that they own.
